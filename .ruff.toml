# .ruff.toml - Linter configuration for the ecommerce-data-cleaning pipeline
#
# Ignores chosen because:
# - E501: Black formatter handles line length consistently
# - PLR0912/PLR0915: Data validation/audit scripts naturally have many conditional branches
#   and statements due to per-column/per-table checks — refactoring to smaller functions
#   would add complexity without benefit in this scope.
